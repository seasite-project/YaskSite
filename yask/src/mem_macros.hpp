// This file defines macros to use for accessing memory.
// By using these, you can turn on the following:
// - use the cache model when CACHE_MODEL is set to 1 or 2.
// - trace accesses when TRACE_MEM is set.
// - check alignment when DEBUG is set.
// If none of these are activated, there is no cost.
// Also defines macros for PREFETCH and EVICT.
